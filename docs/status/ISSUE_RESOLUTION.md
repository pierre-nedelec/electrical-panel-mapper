# Issue Resolution Summary

## üîß **ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

### 1. **Date Display Issue: "Invalid Date"**
**Problem**: Floor plans showed "Created Invalid Date" because the date parsing was inconsistent.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed date property mapping (`created_at` vs `createdAt`)
- Added fallback handling for missing dates
- Updated FloorPlanManager to show "Unknown" for invalid dates

### 2. **Room Count Display**
**Problem**: Room count was showing incorrect numbers due to undefined rooms array.
**Solution**:
- Added safe array checking: `plan.rooms?.length || 0`
- Fixed rooms data parsing from server response

### 3. **Floor Plan Name Not Preserved**
**Problem**: When loading a floor plan for editing, the name wasn't pre-filled in save dialog.
**Solution**:
- Modified FloorPlanDrawer to accept `initialFloorPlan` prop
- Pre-populate `floorPlanName` state with loaded plan name
- Updated save logic to handle both create and update operations

### 4. **Property Mapping Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: Server returns `view_box` and `svg_content`, but frontend expected `viewBox` and `svg`.
**Solution**:
- Updated all components to handle both property formats
- Added fallback checks: `plan.view_box || plan.viewBox`
- Fixed MainScreen, FloorPlanManager, and FloorPlanDrawer

### 5. **Edit vs View Confusion**
**Problem**: No clear distinction between viewing and editing modes.
**Solution**:
- Added separate "View Plan" and "Edit" buttons in FloorPlanManager
- Created new `handleEditPlan` flow in MainScreen
- Updated FloorPlanDrawer title to show edit mode: "Edit Floor Plan: [Name]"

### 6. **Update vs Create Logic**
**Problem**: All saves created new floor plans instead of updating existing ones.
**Solution**:
- Added update logic in FloorPlanDrawer save function
- Check for `initialFloorPlan?.id` to determine update vs create
- Use PUT request for updates, POST for new plans
